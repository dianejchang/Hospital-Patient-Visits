# Overview
This repository contains SQL queries used to analyze patient and visitor data by performing various joins and aggregations. The queries demonstrate different techniques for combining tables, counting visits, and identifying patterns in patient interactions.

# Data Sources
Data was sourced from [Alex the Analyst Portfolio Projects on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/tree/main).

# Tools & Technologies
- GitHub Pages for project hosting and SQL documentation
- PostgreSQL for SQL queries

# Project Structure
### SQL Queries: [Queried and analyzed patient and visitor data](https://github.com/dianejchang/Hospital-Patient-Visits/blob/main/Hospital%20Joins.sql) in PostgreSQL
1. Joining two tables to see all data
2. Displaying distinct patient names
3. Joining two tables to see all data with a right join
4. Joining table via cartesian join to show all pairing possibilities
5. Counting how many visitors each patient had (2 ways)
6. Displaying patients with 3 or more visits
7. Displaying all patients and the number of guests they had
